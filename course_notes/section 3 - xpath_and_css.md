# XPath and CSS

## what are they?
- comes from XML path langauge, it was made to query xml documents, but can be used to select elements. 
syntax is sometimes complex for beginners, but has a lot more functionality.
- cascading style sheets (CSS). It was a language created mainly to style html web pages. usually seems easier to 
learn for beginners with more intuitive, clean syntax.

## 13: CSS selectors (this whole section is worth reviewing when planning out selectors)
- **https://try.jsoup.org/** is a really useful tool for testing css and xpath
- copy code.html to this site and paste into the `input HTML` area and test different CSS tags
- classes vs id's
- we don't just have classes and id's. we can also have href attributes for links, or others like data-identifier
- we also have conditions in css selectors, eg: `a[href^=https]`. This seems a lot like regex
- we can also select based on position: `div.intro p`
- if we want to include its descendants, we can use: `div.intro p, span#location` or `div.intro > p`
- repetition is the mother of learning
