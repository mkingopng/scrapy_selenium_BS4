# Glasses
- the mission is to scrape all the available glasses from 'https://www.glassesshop.com/bestsellers'
- We're interested in getting the 'product url', 'product image link', 'product name' and the 'product price'.
- at the bottom we do have the pagination so make sure to handle that too.
- Finally, make sure to generate a dataset from all the scraped glasses, either a JSON file or a CSV file
