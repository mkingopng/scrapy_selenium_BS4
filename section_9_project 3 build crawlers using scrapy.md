Unfortunately, IMDB has updated their UI which means the HTML markup has also changed. So in order for you to get the
same version of the website I covered in the course, you can use the way-back machine which allows you to go back in
time and load the same version of the website I covered in the course.

Please use this URL

http://web.archive.org/web/20200715000935if_/https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating

instead of

https://www.imdb.com

Not all the web pages are archived (only the first one) which is unfortunate. Sorry about that, it's completely out of my control.

we've been using the basic templates so far.
